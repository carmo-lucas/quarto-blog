  abstract = {Preventing creaming or sedimentation by the addition of thickeners is an important industrial challenge. We study the effect of the addition of a "free" nonadsorbing polymer (xanthan gum) on the stability against creaming of sterically stabilized O/W emulsions. Therefore, we analyze our samples using microscopy and rheological measurements. At low xanthan concentrations, the emulsions cream. However, above a certain concentration a three-dimensional network of droplets is formed, which can prevent creaming. We attribute the formation of this structure to depletion attraction. The rheological behavior of an emulsion that is macroscopically stable should be elastic, while it should be viscous for a creaming emulsion. In order to distinguish between stable and unstable samples, we measure their relaxation time by mechanical rheology and find a good correlation to the visual observation. However, the measured relaxation times are much shorter than the time-scales, on which we observe creaming. We hypothesize that the measured relaxation time is related to the droplet-droplet interaction. This determines the frequency at which microscopic rearrangements occur, which weaken the network structure prior to creaming. Based on this interpretation, the relaxation time gives direct access to the microstructural processes involved in creaming. We therefore suggest using it as a predictive parameter of creaming stability. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Characterization, with emphasis on the rheological properties, of Cassia grandis seeds galactomannan gel containing immobilized Cramoll 1-4 is presented. The gels, with and without immobilized Cramoll 1-4, were evaluated along time by rheometry, pH, color, microbial contamination and lectin hemagglutinating activity (HA). Rheological determinations confirmed the gels to be very stable up to 30 days with variations occurring after this period. Rheological data also showed that the gel/Cramoll 1-4 immobilizing matrix loses its elastic modulus substantially after 60 days. Both gels presented no microbial contamination as well as a pH close to neutral. Colorimetric parameters demonstrated the gels transparency with occasional yellowness. The opacity of the galactomannan gel did not change significantly along the study; the same did not occur for the gel with immobilized Cramoll 1-4 as a statistically significant reduction of its opacity was observed. In what concerns immobilized Cramoll 1-4 HA, up to 90\% of its initial HA was maintained after 20 days, with a decrease to 60\% after 60 days. These results combined with the thickening and stabilizing characteristics of the galactomannan gel make this gel a promising immobilizing matrix for Cramoll 1-4 that can be further exploited for clinical and cosmetic applications.},

We further propose a definition of the solid-like characteristics of gels in terms of the dynamic mechanical properties, viz. a storage modulus, G′(\$ω\$), which exhibits a pronounced plateau extending to times at least of the order of seconds and a loss modulus, G″(\$ω\$), which is considerably smaller thatn the storage modulus in the plateau region.},

It was evaluated the influence of silicone surfactants on the emulsions stability and on the formation of liquid crystalline phases and therefore, physicochemical characteristics, such as rheology and zeta potential, were evaluated. Emulsions were prepared by the emulsions phase inversion method. All the formulations presented lamellar liquid crystalline phases. The PEG-12 Dimethicone addition did not change microscopically the liquid crystalline phases. The emulsions containing silicone demonstrated lower viscosity than those without the additive. This is an important feature, as the silicone did not change the rheological profile; however, the addition of silicone still can be used as a viscosity controller. The formulations had their viscosity increased 15 and 150 days after their preparation. This characteristic shows that the emulsions have their organization increased along the storing time. In the analysis of zeta potential, we could verify that all formulations presented negative values between -39.7 and -70.0 mV. Within this range of values, the emulsion physical stability is high (Fig. 10). It was concluded that the addition of PEG-12 Dimethicone kept the liquid crystalline phase of the emulsion obtained with Crodafos CES®, influencing in a positive way in the system stability. © 2007 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Concentrated emulsions containing both proteins and polysaccharides are the basis for many commercial products; however, the effects of protein–polysaccharide interactions on the functional properties of these complex systems are often poorly understood from a fundamental standpoint. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of fish gelatin (FG)-gum arabic (GA) complexation at different aqueous phase pH (3.6, 5.0, and 9.0) on concentrated emulsion structure–function relationships. Concentrated emulsions were prepared using FG-GA mixtures and characterized by rheometry and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). CSLM images showed that all samples were O/W emulsions; emulsions with lower pH showed smaller oil droplets, greater homogeneity in size distribution, and higher stability. This was attributed to an increased number of FGGA complexes in the emulsification. Electrostatic attractive interactions and charge neutralization created biopolymer associations with increased emulsification capacity. Samples with FG-GA mixtures at lower pH showed higher elastic moduli under small deformation and exhibited greater deviation between apparent and complex viscosities under the Cox-Merz rule, indicating increased gel network extension and greater intermolecular connectivity between adsorbed layers of adjacent oil droplets. These results can be used to incorporate protein–polysaccharide complexes as a suitable emulsifier in materials comprising concentrated emulsions.},

  abstract = {Thermal recovery techniques and solvent-based EOR methods are not applicable in many of thin post cold heavy oil production with sands (CHOPS) heavy oil reservoirs in Western Canada. Therefore, alkaline-surfactant flood has been suggested as an alternative to develop these reservoirs. The main mechanism behind these processes has been attributed to the effect of synthetic surfactant and natural soap, created due to the reaction of alkaline with acidic crude, to form an oil in water emulsion. The created emulsions can plug the very high permeable wormholes in post CHOPS heavy oil reservoirs to improve sweep efficiency. In these processes the efficiency of the process is improved with increasing the stability of the emulsions. Therefore, this review was aimed to investigate the potential application of nanoparticles, with the main focus on silica nanoparticles as the most cost-effective ones, along with synthetic or natural surfactants created by alkaline-surfactant flooding to boost the stability of oil in water emulsions. It was found that very hydrophilic silica nanoparticles (NP) tend not to adsorb at the oil-water interface and so they need to be surface activated to be able to work as emulsifiers. Different techniques including in-situ (i.e. surfactant-assisted) versus ex-situ (i.e. either surface-coating the nanoparticles or physically-enforced attachment of NP to the interface) techniques have been used to reduce nanoparticles hydrophilicity among which in-situ methods seem to be more practical in oil field applications. All types of surfactants and their effects on the hydrophilicity of silica NP were discussed in detail. All the literature discusses NPs effects to emulsify simple oils like decane, dodecane, 1-octadecene, n-hexane, kerosene, toluene, mineral oil, vegetable oil, paraffin, etc. in water. There is very little research done with crude oil, which is not comparable to the corresponding ideal systems work. It is concluded that although there are some clues in the literature addressing the emulsion stability due to mixing of surfactant with NPs of similar charge, the most stable oil in water emulsions can be obtained when the system contains oppositely-charged surfactants and NPs i.e., anionic NPs along with cationic surfactants or cationic NPs along with anionic surfactants. Therefore, it seems that the most influential factor is having two emulsifiers with different charges and the system chemistry is of less importance. In these cases, at specific surfactant concentrations the electrostatic interactions between NPs and surfactant molecules result in the least stable and most flocculated NPs which is reported as the most suitable condition (corresponding to the most favorable state for NPs hydrophobicity) to stabilize oil in water emulsions. Furthermore, adding a large amount of energy into the system by ultrasonication decreases the size of oil droplets which in turn, increases their surface area on which NPs have a higher chance to adsorb.},

In particular, the rheological properties of aqueous scleroglucan systems were investigated under continuous and oscillatory shear conditions in a polymer concentration range (0.2-1.2\% w/w) embracing the sol/gel transition. The effects due to the addition of two different surfactants (up to 10\% w/w) were examined at constant polymer concentration (0.4\% w/w). The selected additives are a nonionic polymeric siliconic surfactant (dimethicone copolyol) and a cationic surfactant (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide), respectively. Polysaccharide-surfactant interactions leading to complex formation were detected also through rheology. The combined action of both nonionic and cationic surfactants in the polymer solution was examined at two different surfactant concentration levels (5 and 10\% w/w), demonstrating the beneficial effects produced on the mechanical properties of the polymer matrix by the coexistence of both surfactants. Such beneficial effects are confirmed by the stability and rheology shown by the emulsions prepared. In this way, the results point out the good agreement between the rheology of the continuous phase and the final characteristics of the emulsion obtained. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The structure of a stable O/W cream is characterized by a more or less pronounced mixed crystal bilayer.[1] The addition of co-emulsifiers in order to achieve a soft formulation often leads to a mixed crystal bilayer network of high viscosity and even phase separation. In order to ovoid this components of different chemical identities are used which often are not inert or harmless if they are absorbed. For this reason it seems to be interesting to use only components from one chemical family, e.g. to use only glycerides and their derivatives because in the case of absorption they are metabolized. The disadvantages of glyceride creams are, however, their low viscosity. The aim of this investigation was to find the optimum amount of co-emulsifier as consistency excipient for the basic formulation of an O/W glyceride cream. This was achieved by using differential scanning calorimetry; thermogravimetry, oscillation rheology and various stress tests. The amount of co-emulsifier used should not be too high, as it would crystallize increasingly during storage which gives the preparation an optical inhomogenity and a lack in softness which is needed for a suitable cosmetic acceptance. A slightly higher concentration than is necessary for the mixed emulsifier system can be advantageous, as the formation of a separate crystalline lipophilic network in the preparation increases its viscosity which will lead to a higher physico-chemical stability of the formulation. These results were obtained with the co-emulsifiers glyceryl monostearate (Imwitor® 900), cetylstearyl alcohol (Lanette® O), and PEG-20-glycerolstearate (Tagat® S2) as O/W emulsifier. As oil phase a mixture of Miglyol® 812 (caprylic/capric triglyceride) and Avocado oil was used. Copyright © Informa UK, Ltd.},

This book introduces the subject of rheology in terms understandable to non-experts and describes the application of rheological principles to many industrial products and processes. It provides a simple but authoritative guide which shows clearly how mathematics, physics and chemistry have contributed to the development of rheology. The generic features of all liquid-like materials are summarised, i.e. viscosity, linear viscoelasticity, normal stresses and extensional viscosity. Particular systems are then discussed, i.e. polymeric liquids and suspensions. The final chapter gives an outline of the theoretical advances which have been made. Consistent notation and nomenclature have been used throughout the book, and the key textbooks and publications which will enable the reader to follow up particular topics are listed.},

A graphical procedure is given from which the coordination number and the strength of the cooperativity can be directly evaluated from experimental stress relaxation data. For flow in the linear regime other instances of flow are calculated and the results are, qualitatively: t1 z, time dependence of strain in creep; ω1 z, frequency dependence of dynamic moduli; t1-1 2, time dependence of stress in constant rate of strain experiments. It is further proposed that non-Newtonian steady flow in structured liquids may be explained as a cooperative relaxation phenomenon and it is shown that a region with cooperative flow τ ∼ D1 z (τ shear stress, D shear rate) exists above the region of Newtonian flow at low shear rates. © 1980.}

  abstract = {In recent years, sustainability on the cosmetics industry has received growing interest from consumers, cosmetics industries and organizations, as well as academics from various disciplinary fields. Increasing concerns about cosmetics safety, environmental impacts as deforestation and social impacts as those resulting from unfair trade have intensified attention given to such topic. While sustainability impacts occur through all phases of the cosmetic product life cycle, selection of raw materials is deserving of greater attention as information on this topic remains scattered and diffuse. Formulating with alternative ingredients considered more sustainable can be quite challenging due to possible lack of performance, instability and aesthetic limitations normally associated with their use. This paper discusses the relation between sustainability and the cosmetics industry, the factors stimulating the developments on this field, the need to assess those and the available tools, alongside with the sustainability impacts produced during all the product life cycle. The analysis reveals cosmetics sustainability as a complex and multifaceted issue that cannot be evaluated considering single aspects, but using an integrated assessment about the environmental, social and economical dimensions and about the final product quality and performance.}

  abstract = {Conventional methods for characterizing the stability of cosmetic emulsions are time-consuming and in many cases subjective. To obtain reproducible data about the physical behaviour of cosmetic emulsions a special rheological method was developed. This consisted of a dynamic four-cycle mechanical temperature range test. The "rheological swing test" for cosmetic emulsions was performed with parallel plates at constant frequency in the linear viscoelastic range. During the four cycles the temperature was varied from-10°C to 50°C with a programmed constant temperature gradient. Every 10s the amplitude ratio and phase shift was determined and used to calculate the storage modulus G and the loss modulus G". Cosmetic emulsions of the types oil-in-water and water-in-oil were freshly prepared and conditioned for 48h at RT (relaxation phenomena) before starting the first test. The rheological swing test was performed with an ARES System after preparation in the first, second, third, fourth and eighth week. Stable formulations show no changes in the storage modulus Gánd loss modulus G" over several cycles at corresponding temperatures. No change is detectable in the shape of curves and in the extreme absolute values. During the storage time no significant changes were detectable. Unstable formulations however show changes in the position of the minimum and maximum values of Gánd G" at the highest and lowest temperatures of-10°C and 50°C. The difference between GándGánd G" is less than in the stable formulation. The shape of the curves changes with the cycle time. It is possible to identify the temperature range where the emulsion becomes unstable. Once an instability in a special temperature range has been detected , it is found in all subsequent measurements. This test allows prediction of temperature stability of cosmetic emulsions. Introduction During production, filling, storage and usage cosmetic emulsions are exposed to physical, chemical and microbiological influences. The resultant changes can lead to instabilities. Physical influences such as temperature, light and pressure affect the solubility product and may lead to crystallization and changes in the viscosity. Interactions of the ingredients with each other or the packaging material are examples of chemical influences causing instabilities. Microbiological influences on the stability are caused by fungi, bacteria and yeast. Added to all the instabilities arising from these influences are thermodynamic instabilities that can temporarily}

The structure and flow properties in the surfactant excess region were studied by light scattering and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) as well as by rheology. The unique behaviour of HA to maintain its high viscosity was observed even at very high TTAB concentrations of 496 mM and this effect was systematically studied in the concentration range from 1 to 25 mM HA. From the data, it could be concluded that: (1) extended rod-like structures of the PESCs prevent molecular dissolution of HA by TTAB. (2) HA and TTAB micelles interact rather weakly as seen by a low fraction of bound micelles. (3) At very high TTAB concentrations a decompaction of PESCs (fractal dimension Df going from 2.0 to 1.2) occurs with increasing HA concentration but (4) both the entanglement of HA and the structure of the micelles are not affected.},

Therefore, rheological, texture and sensory analyses are important to understand the behaviour and stability of the formulations. In this context, the aim of this study was to develop cosmetic formulations containing or not (vehicle) UV filters and chicory root extract, to evaluate their stability as well as to characterize their physical and texture properties and correlate them with the sensory attributes. Methods: Four formulations containing organic UV filters and chicory extract, each alone or in combination, were developed and evaluated for 180 days with a cone and plate rheometer, a texture analyzer and consumer's sensorial analysis. Thus, the data obtained were correlated to observe the different influences. Results: The developed formulations remained stable after 180 days regarding macroscopic aspects, organoleptic characteristics and pH values. The addition of the UV filters alone and in combination with the active substance resulted in significant increases in rheology properties, viscosity and consistency. The formulation with the active ingredient showed significant decreases in the texture parameters after 180 days, mainly due to its polysaccharide inulin. All formulations obtained high scores in sensorial parameters. A strong correlation was mainly found between spreadability and work of shear, and between the texture parameters. Conclusion: The raw materials strongly influenced the physical, texture and sensorial parameters. Finally, the UV filters showed a greater influence on the results of the formulations than the chicory root extract. In conclusion, the association of the mentioned methods allows the correct choice of ingredients and their combinations.},

  abstract = {UV radiation-induced skin damages may result in pre-cancerous and cancerous skin lesions, and acceleration of skin aging. It involves an imbalance of the endogenous antioxidant system that leads to the increase of free radical levels and inflammation. Therefore, antioxidant supplementation might inhibit such imbalance. In this regard, quercetin is a promising drug, this plant derived lipophilic flavonoid presents the higher antioxidant activity among flavonoids and multiple antioxidant mechanisms. Thus, the present study investigated the possible beneficial effects of topical formulations containing quercetin to inhibit UVB irradiation-induced oxidative damages. Quercetin was administered on the dorsal skin of hairless mice using two formulations, formulation 1 (non-ionic emulsion with high lipid content) and formulation 2 (anionic emulsion with low lipid content). The UVB irradiation (0.31-3.69 J/cm2) induced a dose-dependent increase in the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (4-2708\%) and depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) (22-68\%) in the skin of hairless mice after 6 h. These results demonstrated that the UVB doses are not excessive, and additionally, they are lower than the doses used in other similar studies. Proteinases secretion/activity, detected by the qualitative sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis substrate-embedded enzymography (zymography), was also enhanced in the same manner as MPO activity using the UVB dose of 1.23 J/cm2. Formulations 1 and 2 inhibited the MPO activity increase (62\% and 59\%, respectively), GSH depletion (119\% and 53\%, respectively) and proteinases secretion/activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of topical formulations containing quercetin to inhibit the UVB irradiation-induced skin damages. Thus, these data suggest the possible usefulness of topical formulations containing quercetin to prevent UVB radiation skin damages. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Controlling the stability and rheological properties of colloidal slurries has been an important but challenging issue for various industries such as cosmetics, ceramic processing, and nuclear waste treatment. For example, at the US Department of Energy Hanford and Savannah River sites, operation of the waste treatment facilities with increased solids loading increases waste processing rates but negatively impacts the rheological properties. We investigated various rheological modifiers on a Fe 2O 3/Al(OH) 3-rich nuclear waste simulant, characterized by high ionic strength and pH, to reduce yield stress of the colloidal slurry. Rheological modifiers change particle interactions in colloidal slurries; they mainly alter the electrostatic and steric interactions, leading to a change in rheological properties. Weak acid-type rheological modifiers strengthen electrostatic repulsion whereas nonionic/polymer surfactant-type rheological modifiers introduce a steric repulsion. Using rheological analysis, it was found that citric acid and polyacrylic acid are good rheological modifiers for the simulant tested, effectively reducing yield stresses by as much as 70\%. Further analysis supports the idea that adding these rheological modifiers increases the stability of the slurry. A likely mechanism for the observed effects of citric acid and polyacrylic acid on slurry behavior is identified as both binding cations in bulk solution and adsorption on the surface of the particles. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The açai’s fruits contain anthocyanins, a class of polyphenols to which antioxidant properties have been attributed. The aim of this work was to develop O/W sunscreens emulsions containing açai glycolic extract (AGE) and to evaluate both their physical stability and photoprotective efficacy. Emulsions containing AGE and sunscreens were formulated using different types and concentrations of polymeric surfactant (acrylates/C 10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer and sodium polyacrylate). The influence of two rheology modifiers (polyacrylamide (and) C13-14/isoparaffin (and) Laureth-7 and Carbomer) on the stability was also investigated. Physical stability was evaluated by preliminary and accelerated studies. Emulsions with 1.0\% sodium polyacrylate were stable and exhibited non-newtonian pseudoplastic behavior and thixotropy. Photoprotective efficacy was evaluated by in vivo Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and determination of Protection Factor of UVA (PF-UVA). When AGE was added to the sunscreen emulsion, no significant increase in the in vivo SPF value was observed. The emulsion containing AGE showed PF-UVA = 14.97, 1.69 of the SPF/PF-UVA ratio and a critical wavelength value of 378 nm, and may therefore be considered a sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection.},

Although recent reports of the oestrogenic properties of parabens have challenged current concepts of their toxicity in these consumer products, the question remains as to whether any of the parabens can accumulate intact in the body from the long-term, low-dose levels to which humans are exposed. Initial studies reported here show that parabens can be extracted from human breast tissue and detected by thin-layer chromatography. More detailed studies enabled identification and measurement of mean concentrations of individual parabens in samples of 20 human breast tumours by high-pressure liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry. The mean concentration of parabens in these 20 human breast tumours was found to be 20.6 ± 4.2 ng g-1 tissue. Comparison of individual parabens showed that methylparaben was present at the highest level (with a mean value of 12.8 ± 2.2 ng g-1 tissue) and represents 62\% of the total paraben recovered in the extractions. These studies demonstrate that parabens can be found intact in the human breast and this should open the way technically for more detailed information to be obtained on body burdens of parabens and in particular whether body burdens are different in cancer from those in normal tissues.

However, above ϕRCP, attractive and repulsive emulsions have similar elasticities. Such compressed attractive emulsions undergo an additional shear-driven relaxation process during yielding. Our results suggest that attractive emulsions begin to yield at weak points through the breakage of bonds, and, above ϕRCP, also undergo droplet configurational rearrangements. © 2011 American Physical Society.}

Excess βLGm preferentially entered the AMP phase at pH {$>$} 5.0 and the XG phase at lower pH. The inversion was caused by adsorption of XG onto βLGm that started below pH 5.5.

Emulsions are widely used in industrial applications, including in food sciences, cosmetics, and enhanced oil recovery. For these industries, an in depth understanding of the stability and rheological properties of emulsions under both static and dynamic conditions is vital to their successful application. Presented here is a thorough assessment of a model nanoparticle (NP) stabilized dodecane-in-water emulsion as a route to improved understanding of the relationship between NP properties, microstructure and droplet–droplet interactions on the stability and rheological properties of emulsions. Emulsions are obtained here with low NP loadings without the need for added electrolyte through the use of an optimized silica NP (SNP) surface modification procedure. The prepared emulsions were characterized via optical microscopy, cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM), zeta potential analysis and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), enabling quantification of the emulsion droplet size, SNP interfacial coverage/morphology and surface charge. The correlation of these properties with the rheology of the emulsions is investigated through small amplitude oscillatory shear experiments which provide significant insight into the origins of the emulsions' rheological behavior and their stability. In addition, long-term stability, droplet–droplet network formation and microstructural evolution are found to be readily detectable shortly after preparation through measured progression of the emulsion's rheological properties.},

  abstract = {The review is devoted to the historical and modern understanding of rheological properties of emulsions in a broad range of concentration. In the limiting case of dilute emulsions, the discussion is based on the analogy and differences in properties of suspensions and emulsions. For concentrated emulsions, the main peculiarities of their rheological behaviour are considered. Different approaches to understand the concentration dependencies of viscosity are presented and compared. The effects of non-Newtonian flow curves and the apparent transition to yielding with increasing concentration of the dispersed phase are discussed. The problem of droplet deformation in shear fields is touched. The highly concentrated emulsions (beyond the limit of closest packing of spherical particles) are treated as visco-plastic media, and the principle features of their rheology (elasticity, yielding, concentration and droplet size dependencies) are considered. A special attention is paid to the problem of shear stability of drops of an internal phase starting from the theory of the single drop behaviour, including approaches for the estimation of drops' stability in concentrated emulsions. Polymer blends are also treated as emulsions, though taking into account their peculiarities due to the coexistence of two interpenetrated phases. Different theoretical models of deformation of polymer drops were discussed bearing in mind the central goal of predictions of the visco-elastic properties of emulsions as functions of the properties of individual components and the interfacial layer. The role of surfactants is discussed from the point of view of stability of emulsions in time and their special influence on the rheology of emulsions.},

Confocal microscopy shows that the clay particles are not only located at the interface but also aggregate and form a gel in the continuous phase. Our results suggest that the formation of the emulsions is mostly due to this gel formation, rather than that the clay is an emulsifier.Colloidal particles are often used to make Pickering emulsions that are reported to be very stable. Commonly the stabilization is a combined effect of particle adsorbing at the fluid interface and a particle network in the continuous phase; the contribution of each to the overall stability is difficult to assess. We investigate the role of LAPONITE®particles on high internal phase emulsion stability by considering three different situations: emulsion stabilization by surfactant only, by surfactant plus clay particles, and finally clay particles only. To clarify the structure of the emulsion and the role of the clay particles, we have succeeded in fluorescently labelling the clay particles by adsorbing the dye onto the particle surfaces. This allows us to show directly using confocal microscopy, that the clay particles are not only located at the interface but also aggregate and form a gel in the continuous aqueous phase. We show that the emulsions in the presence of surfactant (with or without clay) are stable to coalescence and shear. Without surfactant (with only LAPONITE®as stabilizer) the emulsions are stable to coalescence for several weeks, however they destabilize rapidly under shear. Our results suggest that the formation of the emulsions is mostly due to gel formation of the clay particles in the continuous phase, rather than that the clay is an emulsifier. This gel formation also accounts for the instability of the emulsions to shear that we observe caused by shear thinning of the continuous gel and inability of the adsorbed particles to rearrange effectively around the droplets due to their attractive nature.},

  abstract = {©2017 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie Objective: Consumers' demand for improved products' performance, alongside with the obligation of meeting the safety and efficacy goals, presents a key reason for the reformulation, as well as a challenging task for formulators. Any change of the formulation, whether it is wanted – in order to innovate the product (new actives and raw materials) or necessary – due to, for example legislative changes (restriction of ingredients), ingredients market unavailability, new manufacturing equipment, may have a number of consequences, desired or otherwise. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of multiple factors – variations of the composition, manufacturing conditions and their interactions, on emulsion textural and rheological characteristics, applying the general experimental factorial design and, subsequently, to establish the approach that could replace, to some extent, certain expensive and time-consuming tests (e.g. certain sensory analysis), often required, partly or completely, after the reformulation. Methods: An experimental design strategy was utilized to reveal the influence of reformulation factors (addition of new actives, preparation method change) on textural and rheological properties of cosmetic emulsions, especially those linked to certain sensorial attributes, and droplet size. Results: The general experimental factorial design revealed a significant direct effect of each factor, as well as their interaction effects, on certain characteristics of the system and provided some valuable information necessary for fine-tuning reformulation conditions. Upon addition of STEM-liposomes, consistency, index of viscosity, firmness and cohesiveness were decreased, as along with certain rheology parameters (elastic and viscous modulus), whereas maximal and minimal apparent viscosities and droplet size were increased. The presence of an emollient (squalene) affected all the investigated parameters in a concentration-dependent manner. Modification of the preparation method (using Ultra Turrax instead of a propeller stirrer) produced emulsions with higher firmness and maximal apparent viscosity, but led to a decrease in minimal apparent viscosity, hysteresis loop area, all monitored parameters of oscillatory rheology and droplet size. Conclusion: The study showed that the established approach which combines a general experimental design and instrumental, rheological and textural measurements could be appropriate, more objective, repeatable and time and money-saving step towards developing cosmetic emulsions with satisfying, improved or unchanged, consumer-acceptable performance during the reformulation.},

For this purpose, eight hydrophilic polymers, either natural (e.g. xanthan gum), or natural modified (e.g. hydroxyethyl cellulose) or synthetic (e.g. carbomer), were incorporated in an O/W emulsion at a concentration of 1\% w/w. In addition, a formulation without any polymer was also prepared to be used as a control. The rheological assessment was carried out by analyzing continuous shear flow, creep-recovery and dynamic oscillatory tests, while penetration and compression tests were performed using a texture analyzer under various experimental conditions. This work showed that rheology and texture analysis are useful and complementary tools to allow full understanding of the role of a particular ingredient in an emulsion formulation. It notably allowed establishing that distinct shear thinning behavior induce marked differences for the textural parameters. As an example, the xanthan-based emulsion was the system for which the textural parameters obtained during texture analysis were the less affected by increasing probe speed or container's diameter, due to its extreme shear thinning behavior as evidenced by flow rheometry. ©2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work was to investigate how instrumental measurements could predict the sensory texture of cosmetic emulsions. Eight oil-in-water emulsions, only varying by their polymeric constituent and one "control" emulsion without any polymer were formulated for this purpose. Six texture attributes were selected and precisely defined, with accurate sensory evaluation procedures and notation scales, using the Spectrum™ Descriptive Analysis method; these were Gloss, Integrity of Shape, Penetration Force, Compression Force, Stringiness and Difficulty of Spreading. Besides, an extensive rheological characterization of the creams was carried out, including flow, creep and oscillation tests. In addition, an instrumental textural characterization of the emulsions was performed using a texture analyzer, with different tests of penetration, compression, extrusion, stretching and spreadability. The gloss was also measured on emulsion films using a gloss meter. Predictive models were developed using linear simple, linear multiple and Partial Least Square (PLS) regressions. Univariate analysis showed that Gloss, Compression Force and Difficulty of Spreading were very well predicted by imitative instrumental measurements (R2=0.994, 0.961 and 0.968, respectively). Several good calibration models were built for each of the three other attributes (Radjusted2{$>$}0.914). Five commercial cosmetic emulsions were then instrumentally and sensory assessed to test the robustness of each calibration model and cross-validation was used to evaluate their predictability. Stringiness was finally very well predicted by the breaking length of filament, resulting from the imitative test of the sensory protocol (Ratio of Performance to Deviation (RPD)=3.25); whereas Integrity of Shape and Penetration Force were very well predicted by a combination of rheological and textural parameters (RPD=3.62 and 2.90, respectively). ©2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Saponins are natural surfactants, with molecules composed of a hydrophobic steroid or triterpenoid group, and one or several hydrophilic oligosaccharide chains attached to this group. Saponins are used in cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical products, due to their excellent ability to stabilize emulsions and foams, and to solubilize bulky hydrophobic molecules. The foam and emulsion applications call for a better understanding of the surface properties of saponin adsorption layers, including their rheological properties. Of particular interest is the relation between the molecular structure of the various saponins and their surface properties. Here, we study a series of eight triterpenoid and three steroid saponins, with different numbers of oligosaccharide chains. The surface rheological properties of adsorption layers at the air-water interface, subjected to creep-recovery and oscillatory shear deformations, are investigated. The experiments showed that all steroid saponins exhibited no shear elasticity and had negligible surface viscosity. In contrast, most of the triterpenoid saponins showed complex visco-elastic behavior with extremely high elastic modulus (up to 1100 mN m-1) and viscosity (130 N s m-1). Although the magnitude of the surface modulus differed significantly for the various saponins, they all shared qualitatively similar rheological properties: (1) the elastic modulus was much higher than the viscous one. (2) Up to a certain critical value of surface stress, τC, the single master curve described the dependence of the creep compliance versus time. This rheological response was described well by the compound Voigt model. (3) On increasing the surface stress above τC, the compliance decreased with the applied stress, and eventually, all layers became purely viscous, indicating a loss in the layer structure, responsible for the elastic properties. The saponin extracts, showing the highest elastic moduli, were those of Escin, Tea saponins and Berry saponins, all containing predominantly monodesmosidic triterpenoid saponins. Similarly, a high surface modulus was measured for Ginsenosides extracts, containing bidesmosidic triterpenoid saponins with short sugar chains. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The numerical model is first benchmarked by characterizing the rheological behaviour of dilute homogeneous solutions in various configurations, including steady shear, elongational flows, transient shear and oscillatory flows. As an upgrade of complexity, we study the model in presence of non-ideal multicomponent interfaces, where immiscibility is introduced in the LBM description using the "Shan-Chen" model. The problem of a confined viscoelastic (Newtonian) droplet in a Newtonian (viscoelastic) matrix under simple shear is investigated and numerical results are compared with the predictions of various theoretical models. The proposed numerical simulations explore problems where the capabilities of LBM were never quantified before.},

Rotational viscometry, oscillatory rheology and creep compliance and recovery were performed on emulsions aged up to 28. days. Higher water cuts yielded emulsions with a higher bulk viscosity and storage modulus (G') but lower maximum creep compliance (Jmax) values. The development of a more pronounced continuous phase wax crystal network with age led to a corresponding increase in emulsion bulk viscosity and G' as well as a decrease in Jmax. Supporting results for these findings were acquired with light microscopy, solid wax content, and aqueous droplet size analysis. This study established that both water cut and continuous phase wax solidification play a significant role in W/O emulsion rheology, though this greatly depends on the age of the emulsion. Such findings may be used to better understand and tailor emulsion properties in fields such as the petrochemical, cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A series of highly concentrated lipophilic cosmetic emulsions were analysed, in order to determine their rheological and textural properties, as a function of their microstructure. The originality of this study lies in the methodology used, especially the shear-stress scanning analysis. The results of a very powerful and comprehensive dynamic rheological analysis suggest the existence of two critical volume fraction values: besides the "close-packed" value ϕ c , a "slack-packed" value ϕ 0 , close to 0.60 could be demonstrated. It has been shown that the close-packed structure is stable under shear; in constrast, the slack-packed configuration, defined as ϕ 0 {$<$}ϕ{$<$}ϕ c is unstable under shear. A comparison with theoretical models, especially that of Princen, showed good agreement and allowed the close-packed value ϕ c to be defined more precisely as 0.67. The gap between 0.67 and 0.74 is probably indicative of a highly polydisperse distribution, as confirmed by microscopic analysis. Flow experiments confirmed the validity of Princen's model.},

  abstract = {This study was the first attempt to understand if thermal stability of any food product during storage could be determined. In this respect, a novel method, namely, the thermal loop test was used to determine structural changes and thermal stability of creamed honey in this study. The novelty of this method was that thermal stability of a product is tested within a number of thermal cycles over a determined range of temperature. Creamed honey was characterized in terms of physicochemical, thermomechanical and rheological properties. It showed non-Newtonian thixotropic behavior at all temperature levels (10, 25 and 40 °C). Time-dependent flow behavior was successfully defined by Weltman and second order structural models. Hysteresis loop area depended on temperature and decreased with increase in temperature. Creamed honey had liquid-like structure, showing that it had more pronounced viscous nature than elastic nature (G″ {$>$} G′). Temperature sweep tests were conducted to determine temperature dependency of η50, G′ and G″ values using Arrhenius equation. These test results confirmed the thermal stability test results, revealing that thermal loop test can be an accurate method to determine thermal stability of similar food products, as a new information. Relative structural index value (Δ) increased with number of thermal loop, suggesting that creamed honey had low thermal stability and showed a great structural change by the thermal stress applied between 5 °C and 50 °C. These results suggest that crystallized honey be abstained from large temperature fluctuations to avoid from irreversible changes in rheological characters; thus, to maintain spreadability.},

We emphasize studies of monodisperse droplets, since these have led to breakthroughs in the fundamental understanding of dispersed soft matter. This review also covers the rheological properties of attractive emulsions, which can exhibit a dominant elasticity even at droplet volume fractions far below maximal random jamming of hard spheres.},

We have investigated the demulsification kinetics of a model oil-in-water emulsion in a centrifugal field to mimic the forces acting on emulsion droplets in oil/water separators such as hydrocyclones. The rate of growth of separated oil phase and the change in mean droplet diameter of the emulsion layer was measured as a function of surfactant concentration, centrifugal acceleration and time. Demulsification is enhanced with increasing centrifugal acceleration and time and decreasing surfactant concentration. A kinetic analysis was performed that allows to estimate the characteristic coalescence times between droplets in the emulsion and between a droplet and the separated oil interface. The experimental procedure presented in this work can serve as a simple, but useful test to predict the separation efficiency of emulsions in separators with swirling flow fields. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The study of the phase behavior reveals that the continuous medium composition varied with the temperature. Highly concentrated emulsions behave as elastic solids. Monitoring the evolution of their elasticity with time as a function of temperature by rheology is an original way to characterize their aging. This method was used to get more insight into the modification of the behavior of polydisperse emulsions with temperature and time. The elastic modulus decreased exponentially with time in the range of temperatures studied. This was interpreted as a result of coalescence due to a single film rupture frequency which was independent of its thickness. This coalescence mechanism is thermally activated with an activation energy of 50 kBT.},

In this study, four model water-in-oil creams intended for hand care, varying in one emollient component, were submitted to rheological, sensory and textural characterization, and their efficacy was evaluated in in vivo study on human volunteers. Our results indicate that certain alteration restricted to the oil phase induced a change in all investigated characteristics, showing that each instrumental measurement can be used as a sensitive tool in the characterization of cream samples. Regarding the correlation between physical measurements and certain sensory attributes, it is possible to formulate a product with specific sensory characteristics by using pre-defined rheological or textural parameters. To obtain a complete sensory profile of a cosmetic product, a detailed sensory evaluation should be carried out according to the existing standard practices, which are both time- and money-consuming. However, a modified sensory study could be useful for fast in-line screening along with instrumental characterization of a novel cosmetic emulsion product and could be particularly helpful in the process of distinguishing a single formulation from several differing in one component. © 2011 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.},

Vegetable oils have several effects/benefits on skin and can be used in emulsions to release principal active components for cosmetic purposes. Herein, multiple W/O/W emulsions were formulated in a one-step emulsification method, and the resulting anisotropic structures were characterized by x-ray diffraction measurements. The multiple emulsions obtained were stable and maintained their anisotropic structures over 2 years. WAXS (wide-angle x-ray scattering) measurements of these emulsions suggested that the carbon chains of the surfactant around the globules are disposed in a gel network phase. Furthermore, SAXS (small-angle x-ray scattering) measurements indicated that the surfactant is organized in lamellar layers around the globules. Thus, for the first time, we demonstrated that stable lamellar gel phase multiple emulsions can be made from vegetable oils. In addition to having the advantage of being prepared in one step, these emulsions have desirable characteristics that can be used in the cosmetic industry as natural active principles with low surfactant concentration and the unique features of multiple emulsions with gel phases.},

The theory has undergone considerable development since the first edition of this book. This second edition consolidates many of these recent results. The chapter structure of the book has been revised and enlarged to accommodate developments in three major areas : (i) approximations for practical applications, (ii) problems for which integral transform methods do not apply, and (iii) nonlinear behavior. The following new topics are treated at the level of independent, self-contained sections: Spectrum-type representation of properties Glass transition criterion Heat conduction Approximate interrelationships among properties Approximate inversion of Laplace transform Approximate solutions for dynamic problems Extended correspondence principle Crack growth modeled by local failure Crack growth modeled by energy balance Thermoviscoelastic stress analysis Viscoelastic Rayleigh waves Optimal strain history path Nonlinear behavior of elastomers Nonlinear acceleration waves Viscometric flows Nonviscometric flows Viscoelastic lubrication Also, the original section on nonlinear mechanical properties has been extended. Any realistic appraisal of the linear theory reveals it to be reasonably complete and comprehensive. The status of the general nonlinear form of the theory is much less complete, even though admirable progress has been made. The present study of the nonlinear theory reflects this status. Nevertheless, the practical applications of both the linear and nonlinear theories will continue to provide opportunities for technical advancement. I appreciate the support of my work given by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the related area of composite materials. My gratitude goes to the many people who have provided me with helpful comments on the first edition of this book.

  abstract = {Purpose. The aim of this study was to develop a rheological method to evaluate the stability of highly viscous pharmaceutical emulsions. Thereby, the time devoted to the storage tests could be reduced and manufacturers could save time in optimizing their formulations and manufacturing techniques for topical pharmaceutical forms. The influence of the type of oil and the type of emulsifier on the microstructure of the emulsions was also studied. Materials and Methods. The samples were stored at 25 and at 50-C for 6 months and analysed every month using rheological as well as microscopic techniques. The size and the organization of the droplets within the emulsion were determined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy and optical contrast phase microscopy. Results. A decrease in the rheological parameters was observed for the OC emulsions (BTween/Span ̂ emulsions made with olive oil) and the BMontanov ̂ emulsions. The rheological measurements showed that the structure of the OC emulsions and that of the emulsions made with the Montanov 82 emulsifier become more brittle when submitted to a shear force. The micrographs obtained by freeze-fracture electron microscopy showed that for OC only the oil droplets arrange in a network structure. Storage tests at 50-C confirmed the rheological assumptions on the stability of emulsions. Conclusion. The study of the effect of shearing on the emulsions allowed quick discrimination between the emulsions according to their stabilities. The rheological tool gave information on the structure of the emulsions and on the aging process.},

  abstract = {There is increasing consumer pressure for commercial products that are more natural, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, including foods, cosmetics, detergents, and personal care products. Industry has responded by trying to identify natural alternatives to synthetic functional ingredients within these products. The focus of this review article is on the replacement of synthetic surfactants with natural emulsifiers, such as amphiphilic proteins, polysaccharides, biosurfactants, phospholipids, and bioparticles. In particular, the physicochemical basis of emulsion formation and stabilization by natural emulsifiers is discussed, and the benefits and limitations of different natural emulsifiers are compared. Surface-active polysaccharides typically have to be used at relatively high levels to produce small droplets, but the droplets formed are highly resistant to environmental changes. Conversely, surface-active proteins are typically utilized at low levels, but the droplets formed are highly sensitive to changes in pH, ionic strength, and temperature. Certain phospholipids are capable of producing small oil droplets during homogenization, but again the droplets formed are highly sensitive to changes in environmental conditions. Biosurfactants (saponins) can be utilized at low levels to form fine oil droplets that remain stable over a range of environmental conditions. Some nature-derived nanoparticles (e.g., cellulose, chitosan, and starch) are effective at stabilizing emulsions containing relatively large oil droplets. Future research is encouraged to identify, isolate, purify, and characterize new types of natural emulsifier, and to test their efficacy in food, cosmetic, detergent, personal care, and other products.},

Finally, the impact of using mixed emulsifiers on the functional performance of emulsifiers is given, including gastrointestinal fate, oxidative stability, antimicrobial activity, and release characteristics.

In this study, novel, abundant biobased hydrocolloids spruce galactoglucomannans (GGM) and birch glucuronoxylans (GX) were obtained from a forestry biorefining process and characterized as versatile stabilizers of rapeseed oil-in-water emulsions. For the first time, GGM and GX isolated by pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) of spruce and birch saw meal, respectively, were studied in emulsions. The PHWE wood hemicelluloses—polysaccharides with relatively low molar mass—facilitated the formation of emulsions with small average droplet size and efficiently prevented droplet coalescence. GGM and GX lowered the surface tension of emulsions' oil–water interface and increased the viscosity of the continuous phase. However, viscosity of the wood hemicellulose-based systems was low compared to that of commercial polymeric stabilizers. GGM-stabilized emulsions with varying oil volume fractions were characterized in terms of their rheological properties, including large amplitude oscillation shear (LAOS) measurements, and compared to emulsions prepared with a classical small-molecular surfactant, Tween20. The physical emulsion stabilization mechanisms of GGM and GX are suggested as steric repulsion assisted by Pickering-type stabilization. Wood hemicelluloses have potential as highly promising future bioproducts for versatile industrial applications involving colloidal systems and soft materials.},

Coupling between selected sensory variables (such as softness when removing cream from the pot and the "spreadability" on the back of the hand) and rheological parameters was carried out for both models. A close coupling (and hence mutual substitution) between the rheological and sensory parameters enabled evaluation of the sensory parameters by the rheological ones and thus, saving time and money consuming sensory assessment by fast instrumental rheological analysis. It was shown that a proper choice of an empirical model substantially broadens the range of these substitutions.},

Correlations between rheological and physical data, as moisture content and particle size, were determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. A moderate positive correlation was verified between particle size distribution and flow index, and a strong positive correlation between particle size and flow index. It was also found that the higher the moisture content, the higher the consistency index, quality factor, and apparent viscosity.

  abstract = {Texture and rheology properties of fatty acid salt-fatty acid mixture stabilized oil-water (o/w) emulsions are being explored. While NaOH solution was introduced as aqueous phase, oil phase contained in it dissolved lauric acid. When these oil and water phases are brought in contact, a portion of lauric acid transforms into sodium laurate in situ via acid-base reaction, the combination of which at a certain threshold concentration and above is believed to act as emulsifier in stabilizing the given o/w emulsion system. Light microscopy under cross polarizing conditions suggested that in addition to the formation of surfactant stabilized emulsion droplets, formation of molecular aggregates of vesicle type is imminent in these conditions, both the size and number density of which is found to be a function of emulsifier concentration ratio. The concentration of emulsifier (sodium laurate-lauric acid) is being assessed in this work indirectly as a function of NaOH concentration, due to the problem associated with its quantification. Non or a very small number of vesicles was observed at NaOH concentration below 0.4M, whilst in the presence of 0.4-0.8M NaOH the vesicle population increased substantially. While vesicle population density decreased past 0.8M NaOH, their size increased with NaOH concentration from 0.8 to 1M. These observations suggested that sodium laurate-lauric acid concentration ratio that corresponds to 0.6-0.8M NaOH is the optimum NaOH concentration at which maximum vesicle number density is observed. As far as rheology properties are concerned, at any given \$\textbackslash gamma\{\textbackslash\$\}̇, in the absence of NaOH, the \$\textbackslash eta\{\textbackslash\$\}of the oil solubilized lauric acid was found to be much lower than the \$\textbackslash eta\{\textbackslash\$\}of corresponding sodium laurate-lauric acid stabilized o/w emulsion. Though \$\textbackslash eta\{\textbackslash\$\}(\$\textbackslash gamma\{\textbackslash\$\}̇) profiles of sodium laurate-lauric acid stabilized o/w emulsion was not a linear function under the given sets of experimental conditions, at all conditions \$\textbackslash eta\{\textbackslash\$\}strongly depended on sodium laurate-lauric acid concentrations (concentration of NaOH in this case). What more is that at any given \$\textbackslash gamma\{\textbackslash\$\}̇, the \$\textbackslash eta\{\textbackslash\$\}was observed to be maximum at sodium laurate-lauric acid concentration ratio that corresponded to 0.8M NaOH, a situation which corresponds to the presence of the maximum vesicle number density. In addition to \$\textbackslash eta\{\textbackslash\$\}, in the presence of 0.8M NaOH, higher values of \$\textbackslash sigma\{\textbackslash\$\}Ywas observed, implying that at this particular NaOH concentration these emulsions possessed greater degree of emulsion structuring compared to other NaOH concentrations. These observations lead to the conclusion that sodium laurate concentration plays a great role in the formation of fatty acid salt vesicles, that under the given set of conditions sodium laurate-lauric acid concentration corresponding to 0.8M NaOH is the optimum concentration at which maximum number of vesicles are produced, and that rheology property of these emulsions depend not only on emulsion droplets but also on the vesicle number density and size. Test on oscillatory shear mode also suggested that much like o/w emulsions stabilized with other type surfactant, the viscoelastic properties of these sodium laurate-lauric acid stabilized o/w emulsions depended highly on surfactant concentration. The fact that G″ response was dominant over G′ response at all measured frequency and sodium laurate-lauric acid concentration, it is evident that viscous property dominated over elastic property in these emulsion. The good news is that improved elastic property is observed at sodium laurate-lauric acid concentration that corresponded to 0.6-0.8M NaOH. And not only, in the presence of 0.8M NaOH, while G″ response of these samples was dominant over G′ response at low domain, the dynamic moduli crossed-over at around 2Hz, past which the G′ response became dominant over G″. This implies that, at this particular surfactant concentration, emulsions stabilized with sodium laurate-laurate mixture displays an excellent viscoelastic property pertaining to emulsions used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. This further suggests that in the presence of 0.8M NaOH these o/w emulsion both spread easily and stabilized better as well as possess long storage stability and shelf life. With these dynamic moduli responses it is not surprising that the \$\textbackslash delta\{\textbackslash\$\}of these sodium laurate-lauric acid stabilized emulsions decreased with NaOH concentration from 0.4 to 0.8M. The fact that these emulsion showed smallest \$\textbackslash delta\{\textbackslash\$\}in the presence of 0.8M NaOH as opposed to other NaOH concentrations, it is evident that solid-like elastic property of these emulsions is enhanced and improved at this NaOH concentration. As far as oil type is concerned mineral oil based systems showed better rheology properties compared to corresponding paraffin oil based systems. ©2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These compounds are known to exert a weak estrogenic activity, with butylparaben showing the most potent activity among methyl-, ethyl- and propyl esters in in vitro recombinant yeast assay and in in vivo uterotrophic assay. To account for potential reproductive effects in male animals, butylparaben was administered to 3-week- old Wistar rats divided in groups of eight subjects, at doses of 0.00\%, 0.01\%, 0.10\% and 1.00\% with the animal's diet. After 8 weeks, the rats were killed by decapitation and the weights of the testes, epididymides, prostates, seminal vesicles and preputial glands were recorded. The absolute and relative weights of epididymides were decreased in a dose-dependent manner and the decrease was statistically significant at 0.10\% and above. The cauda epididymal sperm reserve of all treated groups was significantly decreased. The sperm count of the group receiving the highest dose was 58.2\% of control values. The daily sperm production (DSP) in the testis was also significantly lower in all treated groups when compared to controls. Serum testosterone concentration was lowered dose-dependently and was significant at 0.1\% or more. The daily intake of butylparaben that caused these disruptions is similar to the lower level of acceptable daily intake (ADI) for parabens in the European Community (EC) and in Japan. The results of the present experiments show for the first time that exposure of a postweaning mammal to butylparaben had an adverse effect on the secretion of testosterone and in the functions of the male reproductive system. © 2001, Sage Publications.

A priori predictions of the rheological properties of simple emulsions are possible using the existing models. Multiple emulsions have received less attention.

  abstract = {The stability of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) multiple emulsions was investigated using rheological measurements, droplet size analysis and optical microscopy. Both steady state and oscillatory measurements were carried out simultaneously. The W/O/W emulsion was prepared using a lipophilic surfactant mixture (triglycerol triricinoleate and sorbitan monooleate) and an ABA block copolymer of poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide) (Synperonic PEF127). The composition of the lipophilic surfactant mixture was investigated and it was shown that the triglycerol triricinoleate alone or with small additions of sorbitan monooleate gave the best stability. The effect of the Synperonic PEF127 concentration was investigated using rheological measurements as well as droplet size analysis. This showed that the PEF127 concentration should not exceed 1.2\%; otherwise some oil-in water emulsion droplets are produced within the multiple emulsion. Optical microscopy investigations confirmed the results obtained using rheology and droplet size analysis. A multiple emulsion with optimum composition of surfactants remained stable for 223 days at room temperature. The results of these investigations demonstrated that very stable multiple emulsions could be produced provided the system is optimised. The rheological measurements provided a powerful tool to investigate the stability without the need of diluted systems. © 1994.},

  abstract = {The role of water droplets as rheology modifiers in fat crystal-stabilized emulsions is not widely studied, but relevant to many fields and industries such as foods and cosmetics. The degree to which water droplets interact with the surrounding fat crystal network can impart a significant effect on rheology. The objective of this study was to investigate how the rheology of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions stabilized by a surrounding fat crystal network is impacted by the ability of emulsifiers that promote interfacial fat crystallization and whether droplet size is a contributing factor. Three emulsifiers imparting different interfacial characteristics were chosen: glycerol monooleate (GMO) and glycerol monostearate (GMS) both promoted interfacial crystallization in the presence of hydrogenated soy oil (HSO) whereas polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) did not. Different homogenization methods were used to create emulsions with two distinct average droplet sizes with narrow size distributions for each emulsifier. Amplitude sweeps showed that GMS emulsions, independently of droplet size, displayed the highest elastic modulus (Gʹ) values followed by GMO, and then PGPR. Reinforcement (R = Gʹemulsion/GʹHSO network) values increased with each emulsifier over time, but its extent was dependent on emulsifier-mediated droplet-droplet interactions. In both GMO and GMS-stabilized emulsions, smaller droplets enhanced reinforcement whereas the opposite was observed in PGPR-stabilized emulsions. This study has shown that, through the use of different emulsifiers, the droplet interface should be considered a functional component that can used to tailor the consistency of fat crystal-stabilized W/O emulsions.},

Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Due to these new and emerging challenges in scientific imaging, ImageJ is at a critical development crossroads. We present ImageJ2, a total redesign of ImageJ offering a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. ImageJ2 provides a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs.},

  abstract = {The present paper starts with a review of fundamental descriptions based on physico-chemical laws derived for emulsions with a special interest for eventual evidences of drops deformation. A critical analysis of theories and experiments is given that leads the authors to propose new static and dynamic models for the approach to flocculation and coalescence of two deformable drops in dense and dilute environments of other neighboring drops. The model developed is based on an old paper by Albers and Overbeek for W/O dense emulsions with non-deformable particles, that has been improved recently first by Sengupta and Papadopoulos and then by Mishchuk et al. to account for all the interaction forces (electrostatic, van der Waals and steric). The basic idea here rests in the assumption that the flat surface area of the two coalescing drops, interacting in the field of other particles, increases when the distance between the particles decreases according to an exponential law with a characteristic length related to the disjoining force in the inter-particle film and to the capillary pressure that opposes flattening. The difficulty lies, indeed, in manifold interpretations on experimental observations so that no clear conclusion can be derived on mechanisms responsible for the deformation of droplets. This is why, from a pure theoretical and physical point of view, according to rather complicated models, we propose a much more simple approach that permits to define a capillary length as part of virtual operations. In a static approach, this length is based on analogy with electricity, namely repulsion leads to flatness while attraction to hump. Therefore this brings us to a definition of a length depending on the maximum value of the disjoining pressure in competition with the capillary pressure. Gravity also promotes flocculation, therefore we compare the maximum values of the surface forces acting between the surfaces of two floculating particles to gravity. Finally, considering that in most publications on emulsions foams and colloidal systems, much attention is paid on the role of the drainage in the stability process, we devote the last section to the drainage between flattened drops. We first describe briefly Taylor's approach and extend Reynolds revisited formulae taking into account the viscous friction, the disjoining pressure, the film elasticity and the wetting angle weighting the capillary pressure through the characteristic length. Our calculated values are compared to some experimental data. In conclusion to make this long paper as useful as possible for research purposes, we have the hope that our understanding of emulsion stability is not only based on knowledge of numerous theoretical and experimental works sometimes controversial given in a critical way but that it gives a new approach based on an interpretation of the drop deformation in terms of a characteristic length linked to a deformation number analogous to a Bond number. ©2007 Elsevier B.V.

The coalescence process was detected, not only by laser diffraction measurements, but also by the analysis of the plateau modulus with aging time. This rheological parameter was also useful to distinguish between grades of flocculation. In addition, the Turbiscan stability index showed that the stability was enhanced at higher homogenization rates for 30 wt\% emulsions, and the opposite was true for 40 wt\% emulsions. The results obtained from the combination of different techniques demonstrated that the most stable emulsion was achieved with the 40 wt\% dispersed phase, using less energy input, which lies at the heart of a sustainable society.},

Emulsions containing Pluronic, regardless of the concentration studied, underwent Ostwald ripening while coalescence controlled the destabilization process of emulsions containing Levenol C201 as the only emulsifier. The physical stability of the emulsions was analysed not only by means of mean diameters determined by laser diffraction but also with respect to their rheological properties and the so-called TSI parameter derived from multiple light scattering measurements with aging time. We propose that the different structures of both surfactants at the oil/water interface may be responsible for the occurrence of different destabilization mechanisms. It is likely that Copolymer Pluronic PE9400 formed multilayers in the emulsions studied, which may promote flocculation during processing and, subsequently, Ostwald ripening. In contrast, Levenol C201 probably formed a compact adsorbed layer with the molecules perpendicularly oriented to the interface. This work illustrates to what extent the combination of information provided by Multiple Light Scattering, rheology and laser diffraction enables the detection and monitoring of destabilization mechanisms such as Ostwald ripening and coalescence. In addition, this research highlights the importance of surfactant selection for the physical stability of emulsions that exhibited similar droplet size distributions just after preparation.},

Various fluids of practical interest, such as liquid foams, droplet emulsions or blood, present such elastoviscoplastic behavior: at low stress, the material behaves as a viscoelastic solid, whereas at stresses above a yield stress, the material behaves as a fluid. When n = 1, a recently introduced elastoviscoplastic model proposed by the author is obtained.

  abstract = {Wound healing is a complex regeneration process, which is characterised by intercalating degradation and re-assembly of connective tissue and epidermal layer. The pH value within the wound-milieu influences indirectly and directly all biochemical reactions taking place in this process of healing. Interestingly it is so far a neglected parameter for the overall outcome. For more than three decades the common assumption amongst physicians was that a low pH value, such as it is found on normal skin, is favourable for wound healing. However, investigations have shown that in fact some healing processes such as the take-rate of skin-grafts require an alkaline milieu. The matter is thus much more complicated than it was assumed. This review article summarises the existing literature dealing with the topic of pH value within the wound-milieu, its influence on wound healing and critically discusses the currently existing data in this field. The conclusion to be drawn at present is that the wound pH indeed proves to be a potent influential factor for the healing process and that different pH ranges are required for certain distinct phases of wound healing. Further systematic data needs to be collected for a better understanding of the pH requirements under specific circumstances. This is important as it will help to develop new pH targeted therapeutic strategies. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Some 15 years ago HAAKE published a booklet “Introduction to Practical Viscometry” which was translated into 7 languages and thus reached many readers worldwide. In the Seventies it was our intention to lecture on viscometry in as many countries as possible to make people aware of what non-Newtonian flow behavior meant and what the technical consequence of the shear rate dependency of many technically important fluids is. At that time in many technical branches such as in the paint industry,the “Ford-cup” was still considered a sufficient tool for foremen in factories to classify paint batches as “good” or “bad”. Orifice viscometers available under the names of Redwood, Sayboldt etc. were priced at some \$100 a piece. Rotational viscometers with a rotor speed programmer and a suitable x/t-recorder were sold at prices almost 100 times higher. It must have caused some amusement at management level when laboratories asked for such large amounts of money for a new rotational viscometer while the “cups” were cheap, unbreakable and had been sufficient for quality control for such a long time. HAAKE is proud for having contributed with its' rotational viscometers, worldwide seminars on viscometry and the above mentioned booklet to the understanding of viscometry as a small but important segment of physics. The growing interest in viscometry during the last decades has led to an astonishing increase in the numbers of viscometers sold, which in turn have found users worldwide both in scientific research and in industrial applications. The HAAKE management in the Seventies, of course, knew of the work of the famous Prof. Weissenberg, who already proved that most fluids in their response to shear stresses exhibited both viscous flow and elastic deformation as soon as the early Forties. Prof. Weissenberg also developed the “Rheogoniometer”, which for the first time enabled the measurement of both the corresponding shear stress signal defining viscosity and the normal force signal characterizing elasticity at a given shear rate. This first top-class rheometer was (by todays' standards) bulky and heavy and it was priced at a quarter of a million dollars, which limited it's sale to only a few outstanding research laboratories around the world. It has been said that in some 30 years only a few hundred of these instruments were actually made and this may have contributed to the fact that the manufacturer eventually dropped this product line. We at HAAKE in 1970 did not dare to offer such highly sophisticated rheometers, which were indeed better than Ford-cups but were priced some 2000-times higher. The last 15 years have seen great changes in the field of rheology and rheometry: Universities and technical colleges are now offering courses in rheometry and it's usage in scientific and technical applications in increasing numbers. Thou- Rheology sands of physicists, chemists and engineers have now understood that in rheology, viscosity and elasticity are linked to each other as closely as “men and women in the human race”: one should not regard one as more important than the other and certainly not completely ignore one factor in favour of the other! Machine tools have improved so much that for instance air bearings with machining tolerances of microns can be regarded as “normal” and strain sensors have been developed that divide a 360° revolution into 1000000 increments or even more. This has led to modern rheometers with a measuring sensitivity which allows an insight into rheological responses which people two decades ago could only have dreamt of. All this would still not have led to much if computerization had not become “everybody's tool” within the last ten years with computer prices dropping unbelievably and their capabilities increasing at the same time. We cannot promote dynamic tests in quality control departments unless a computer can handle phase shifts of sinusodial waves of strain inputs and resulting stress responses by means of a Fourier analysis. Equally, only computers can evaluate “creep and recovery tests” with regression calculations to differentiate between elasticity and viscosity responses as a function of shear history and recovery time. Data evaluation is carried out automatically in a minute or two by people whose mathematical training does not go much beyond simple calculus. 15 years have passed since the first edition of “Introduction to Practical Viscometry” appeared and it is time for a fully revised version including chapters which had then been omitted intentionally and those about which we could not have reported because test methods were not yet fully developed. There are very many good books and papers by famous rheologists such as Walters, Ferry, Cheng, Laun, Gleissle etc. which scientifically-minded readers should refer to. Their works are often quite large volumes which are sometimes difficult to read and comprehend for beginners to rheology. It is hoped that this book, in trying to give simple explanations for often complex phenomena and giving advice on “what to do and what not to do”, can induce readers to gain an insight into a field that is scientifically and technically fascinating and commercially rewarding.},

The evolution of rheological characteristics of the emulsion during the microstructure refinement has been investigated through different protocols of the dynamic and steady-state rheology. An extended refining led to a finer microstructure and resulted in an increase in the elastic modulus, yield stress and viscosity of the emulsion. The droplet size dependency of the elasticity and the yield stress during the refining have also been discussed. The network structure of the dispersed phase, the droplet size and the corresponding interdroplet interactions all govern the rheological characteristics of the final emulsion.},

The classical techniques that can be applied for assessment of creaming or sedimentation, flocculation, Ostwald ripening, coalescence and phase inversion are briefly described. This is followed by several sections on the application of rheological techniques to assess and predict each of these instabilities. This involves the use of steady state shear stress-shear rate measurements, constant stress (creep) measurements and dynamic (oscillatory) techniques. The last section gives an example of model emulsions to illustrate the correlation between the various break-down processes with the rheological characteristics of the system. ©2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The interparticle interactions in concentrated suspensions are described. Four main types of interactions can be distinguished: (i) "Hard- sphere" interactions whereby repulsive and attractive forces are screened. (ii) "Soft" or electrostatic interactions determined by double layer repulsion. (iii) Steric repulsion produced by interaction between adsorbed or grafted surfactant and polymer layers. (iv)and van der Waals attraction mainly due to London dispersion forces. Combination of these interaction energies results in three main energy-distance curves: (i) A DLVO type energy-distance curves produced by combination of double layer repulsion and van der Waals attraction. For a stable suspension the energy-distance curve shows a "barrier" (energy maximum) whose height must exceed 25 kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature). (ii) An energy-distance curve characterized by a shallow attractive minimum at twice the adsorbed layer thickness 2δ and when the interparticle-distance h becomes smaller than 2δ the energy shows a sharp increase with further decrease of h and this is the origin of steric stabilization. (iii) an energy-distance curve characterized by a shallow attractive minimum, an energy maximum of the DLVO type and a sharp increase in energy with further decrease of h due to steric repulsion. This is referred to as electrosteric repulsion. The flocculation of electrostatically and sterically stabilized suspensions is briefly described. A section is devoted to charge neutralization by polyelectrolytes and bridging flocculation by polymers. A distinction could be made between "dilute", "concentrated" and "solid suspensions" in terms of the balance between the Brownian motion and interparticle interaction. The states of suspension on standing are described in terms of interaction forces and the effect of gravity. The bulk properties (rheology) of concentrated suspensions are described starting with the case of very dilute suspensions (the Einstein limit with volume fraction φ ≤ 0.01), moderately concentrated suspensions (0.2 {$>$} φ ≥ 0.1) taking into account the hydrodynamic interaction and concentrated suspensions (φ {$>$} 0.2) where semi-empirical theories are available. The rheological behavior of the above four main types of interactions is described starting with "hard-sphere" systems where the relative viscosity-volume fraction relationship could be described. The rheology of electrostatically stabilized suspensions was described with particular reference to the effect of electrolyte that controls the double layer extension. The rheology of sterically stabilized systems is described using model polystyrene suspensions with grafter poly(ethylene oxide) layers. Finally the rheology of flocculated suspensions was described and a distinction could be made between weakly and strongly flocculated systems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper presents basic research results for production of W/O, O/W and W/O/W cosmetic emulsions under ultrasonic irradiation. A technology for the continuous and batch treatment of fluid mixtures with ultrasound was characterized using cosmetic emulsions as model systems. If cavitation is the dominant mechanism of droplet disruption, these results have to be taken into account for an optimal design of the emulsification apparatus geometry. The theoretical model supports experimental work. The experimental findings prove that final drop size essentially depends on specific power density. Drop size decreases with increasing residence time in the ultrasonic field until a system specific, minimum drop size is obtained. Ultrasonic irradiation leads to turbulent flow conditions on a macroscopic and a microscopic scale. The model based on the theory of turbulent drop bread-up predicts drop size and can be used to design equipment for ultrasonic emulsification. Emulsion used were stabilized using a combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfactants. The ratio of this surfactants is important in achieving stable cosmetic emulsions. It was shown that emulsifier concentration plays great role in controlling the emulsification processes as well as the structured features of the droplets. The rheological behavior and morphological evolution during the ultrasonic emulsification were characterized systematically. The rheological properties were used to asses emulsion stability. ©2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

The viscoelastic property of the olive oil emulsions was investigated with a cone-and-plate system, using a Bohlin C-VOR Rheometer. The obtained results indicated that the emulsions with greater oil and surfactant concentrations are highly packed systems with greater interdroplet interactions as well as higher critical strain. The viscoelastic property of the emulsions can be enhanced by increasing the oil concentration. The elastic modulus of the emulsions was always predominant over the viscous modulus, thereby emphasizing the elastic character of the above mentioned emulsions. The emulsion with a higher oil composition shows greater elasticity, which implies a strong dynamic rigidity of the emulsions. A high oil composition also enhanced the structural integrity as well as the interdroplet interactions of the emulsion.© Appl. Rheol.},

  abstract = {Ostwald ripening in emulsions is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the application of the Lifshitz, Slezov and Wagner theory to emulsion systems. The rate of ripening within single component disperse phase emulsions can be described using this theory, provided certain parameters are known, these being the solubility and diffusion coefficient of the disperse phase within the bulk phase, the interfacial tension between the droplets and the bulk phase. The rates of ripening (defined as the rate of change in the cube of the average radius with time) are shown to be linearly dependent upon the interfacial tension below the CMC of the surfactant stabilizing the emulsion, but show only a weak dependence upon the concentration of micelles above the CMC. The effects of the addition of a less soluble component to the disperse phase is also discussed in terms of the treatment given by Kabal'nov et al. It is found that the addition of a longer chain homologue to the disperse phase significantly retards the rate of ripening. This is in accordance to that predicted by the treatment of Kabal'nov et al. The implications that these results have on alkane solubility in water are also discussed and it is concluded that the solubilities of alkanes decrease in water with increasing chain length up to at least octadecane, a result contrary to that reported in the literature. ©1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {In the present study the effect of cosmetic emollients (oils and esters) varying from their chemical structure on the lamellar liquid crystals organization has been investigated. The cetearyl alcohol/cetearyl glucoside emulsifier, known for its ability to form lamellar phases was used at a level of 10\% in emulsions. At this high concentration a strong lamellar network is formed. Also, each of the seven selected emollients was incorporated at level of 20\%, as for a classical cosmetic emulsion. These quantities were necessary in order to assure the presence of lamellar phases in all the samples and to amplify the impact of the emollient on the structural organization of the surfactant. Additionally, a control sample was formulated, containing only emulsifier and water. Emollients were divided as a function of their chemical structure in group A (without heteroatom) and B (with heteroatom). They were first described as a function of the interfacial tension against water, in order to classify them according to their hydrophobicity. The presence of the lamellar phases in all samples was confirmed by means of optical microscopy under polarized light, and then the differences between emulsions physical properties were evidenced by static light scattering and rheological measurements. It was shown that use of A group emollients induces larger droplets size and, respectively, more elastic behavior to the emulsions. This phenomenon is related to the lamellar organization, which is dominated by \$α\$-gel for A group oils and by lamellar liquid crystals combined to \$α\$-gel for B group emollients, as showed through wide angle X-ray diffraction technique. Moreover, the influence of such structures on usage properties of emulsions was characterized via thermal analyses and spreadability tests.},

The evaluation of physical stability was done by keeping the emulsions to storage conditions at 8 ± 0.5 °C, 25 ± 0.5 °C, 40 ± 0.5 °C, and at 40 ± 0.5 °C with 70\% relative humidity (RH) for duration of three months.
